# Testing optimal AMM liquidity in P2P Energy Markets: A bold endeavor
Nalin Bhatt 

This is an Agent-based modeling project that is based on the Monroe et. al (2023) model. We extend the original model by adding an Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and monitoring effects on amounts of solar electricity sold within the market.
